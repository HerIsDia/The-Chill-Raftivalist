# The chill raftivalist

Welcome to **TCR**, a little project who have for goal to just have a little website for listening some [The Survivalist](https://store.steampowered.com/app/897450/The_Survivalists) music.

## How is work ?

In The Survivalist games files, musics are splited in different audio files for do a better experience. For this project, I've use when the player travel to the world with his raft. In this situation, the "global music" played in the game is splited in 5 piece of audio files. (An "intro" and 4 piece of music who together make a loop.)
The project will play the music piece by piece for recreating the "real music" experience.

## Commands

- Start/Stop button: Start or stop the music.

And... that's all.
